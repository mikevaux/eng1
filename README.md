# Engineering 1 - Team ATE

## House Rules

These can be added to as we agree as a team on our way of working, but these 2 are a fairly universal starting point.

1. Never commit directly to `main`. Instead, so all work on a separate branch and create a Pull Request.
2. Do each distinct piece of work on a separate branch. This makes Pull Requests _much_ more useful and manageable, rather than requesting to merge e.g. 5 distinct pieces of work in one go.

## Best Practices Suggestions

1. Name your branches `[username]--[work-description]`, e.g. `mikevaux--readme-setup`. This way, it's clear who's responsible for which piece of work. (If `work-description-2` depends on `work-description-1`, then by all means branch off of `work-description-1`. It will still be clear because `work-description-1 can be merged first when ready.)
